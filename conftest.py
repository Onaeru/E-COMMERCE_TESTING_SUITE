    Saves a screenshot of the browser window if a test fails.

    This implementation of pytest_runtest_makereport is a hook that runs after each test
    has finished. If the test failed, it saves a screenshot of the browser to the
    "screenshots" directory in the current working directory. The screenshot is saved with
    the name "<test_name>_failed.png". If the test did not fail, no screenshot is saved.

    The test name is obtained from the test item object, which is an instance of
    `_pytest.nodes.Item`.

    This hook is marked with `tryfirst=True` to ensure it runs before other hooks. This
    allows the hook to capture any exceptions that occur during teardown, which would
    otherwise be lost if another hook were to run first.
